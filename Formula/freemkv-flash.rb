# The freemkv-flash command-line drive flasher/dumper.
#
# Homebrew downloads with curl, and curl does not set the com.apple.quarantine
# attribute -- only browsers do. So this install is not subject to the Gatekeeper
# prompt a downloaded binary gets, and works whether or not the binary is
# notarized. That is why this formula exists: it is the friction-free way to get
# the CLI on a Mac. The desktop app is a separate cask, freemkv-flash-gui.
#
# freemkv-flash and freemkv-fw are TWO tools in the same repo (freemkv-firmware),
# versioned together; each ships its own formula (CLI) and cask (GUI).

  # No explicit `version`: Homebrew scans it from the version in each URL, so a
  # release bump moves the URLs and the version together and the two can never
  # disagree. `brew audit` flags a standalone version here as redundant.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      freemkv-flash reads and writes optical-drive firmware. `info` and `dump`
      are read-only and safe; `flash` writes -- it backs up first and reads back
      to verify, but it can brick a drive if given the wrong image. It needs a
      drive it can address directly.
